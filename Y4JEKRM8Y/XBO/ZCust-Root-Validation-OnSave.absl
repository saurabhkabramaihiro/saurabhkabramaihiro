/*
	Add your SAP Business ByDesign scripting language implementation for:
		Business Object: Customer
		Node: Root
		Validation: OnSave 

		Script file signature
		----------------------------
		Returns: Boolean
		
	Note: 
	  - To access the elements of the business object node, 
	    use path expressions, for example, this.<element name>. 
	  - To use code completion, press CTRL+J. 
	  - This script file is mass-enabled, i.e. the keyword "this" 
	    refers to a collection of node instances.
	  - The solution uses this script before an instance of the business object is saved to the data base.
		It can have a return value of either true or false, which determines whether the instance of the business object is saved or not.
		All fields in this business object are read-only and cannot be changed.
